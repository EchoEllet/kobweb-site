Kobweb is an opinionated Kotlin framework for creating websites and web apps, built on top of
[Compose HTML](https://github.com/JetBrains/compose-multiplatform#compose-html) and inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
and [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com).

## Goals

Our goal is to provide:

* an intuitive structure for organizing your Kotlin website or web app
* automatic handling of routing between pages
* a collection of useful _batteries included_ widgets built on top of Compose HTML
* an environment built from the ground up around live reloading
* static site exports for improved SEO and potentially cheaper server setups
* support for responsive (i.e. mobile and desktop) design
* shared, rich types between client and server
* out-of-the-box Markdown support
* a way to easily define server API routes
* an open source foundation that the community can extend
* and much, much more!
