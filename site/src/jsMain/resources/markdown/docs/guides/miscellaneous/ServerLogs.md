When you run `kobweb run`, the spun-up web server will, by default, log to the `.kobweb/server/logs` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> You can generate logs using the `ctx.logger` property inside [`@Api` callsâ–²](#define-api-routes).

You can configure logging behavior by editing the `.kobweb/conf.yaml` file. Below we show setting all parameters to
their default values:

```yaml
server:
  logging:
    level: DEBUG # ALL, TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, OFF
    enableConsoleLogging: true # If false, logs will not be written to stdout/stderr
    enableFileLogging: true # If false, a log file will not be created
    logRoot: ".kobweb/server/logs"
    clearLogsOnStart: true # Warning - if true, wipes ALL files in logRoot, so don't put other files in there!
    logFileBaseName: "kobweb-server" # e.g. "kobweb-server.log", "kobweb-server.2023-04-13.log"
    maxFileCount: null # null = unbound. One log file is created per day, so 30 = 1 month of logs
    totalSizeCap: 10MiB # null = unbound. Accepted units: B, K, M, G, KB, MB, GB, KiB, MiB, GiB
    compressHistory: true # If true, old log files are compressed with gzip
```

The above defaults were chosen to be reasonable for most users running their projects on their local machines in
developer mode. However, for production servers, you may want to set `clearLogsOnStart` to false, bump up the
`totalSizeCap` after reviewing the disk limitations of your web server host, and maybe set `maxFileCount` to a reasonable
limit.

Note that most config files assume "10MB" is 10 * 1024 * 1024 bytes, but here it will actually result in
10 * 1000 * 1000 bytes. You probably want to use "KiB", "MiB", or "GiB" when you configure this value.
